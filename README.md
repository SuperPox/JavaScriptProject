# JavaScriptProject

For this project I created a NoteBoard app. I really enjoy using a professional note taking app called Milanote for planning out my game dev projects. I knew I couldn't create all the functionality of Milanote but I wanted to attempt some of it's functionality. In my app you can create Boards, order Boards by dragging and dropping, and double click on boards to add Notes to them.
